## The Swing Arm
To make the swing arm, cut one of your 1×3s to a length of 521/4˝(133cm). At one end of it, drill a 3/8˝(9.5mm) hole 1 inch (25mm) from the end. This hole is for the ballast basket we will make. Drill a second hole 12˝(30cm) from that same end of the swing arm. This hole is for the fulcrum. Mount the swing arm onto the structure of the trebuchet using the fulcrum hole and the steel rod.
