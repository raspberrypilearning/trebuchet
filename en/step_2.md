## What you will need

Everything in this build is very common except for two small parts: a welded ring and several push-on external retaining rings. However, even these are easy to get and you can even improvise something as a replacement for them. We will take a closer look at them as they are needed in the build. And we will offer you possible alternatives. 

We purchased all the parts at a local (US) home improvement store. The wood cost $44.62; the various other parts, paracord, steel bar, nails, screws and everything else cost $28.26, for a total of $72.88. You can reduce this price significantly if you have some of the materials on-hand. A good example is the screws: if you buy full boxes, you’ll have plenty for future projects. If you already have an assortment of nails and screws, you can reduce the cost of this project by $15.
