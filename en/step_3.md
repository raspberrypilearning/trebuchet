## Building the base

Measure and cut the 1 × 4s to form a base for the trebuchet. It is 48˝(122 cm) in length and 12˝ (30 cm) wide. Notice that the 1 × 4s are on their sides. Screw them all together using #8 wood screws that are 2˝(51 mm) long. Cut one of the sheets of plywood in half and nail or screw these halves to the base.

It is important to have this smooth and flat surface because the sling will ride on top of this when the trebuchet fires.
Measure and cut two lengths of 1 × 3 to 30˝ (76 cm) in length and screw them vertically to the base, one on each side and each right in the middle of the base. Drill a 3/8˝ (9.5 mm) hole 1 inch (25 mm) from the top of each of these. Cut your steel bar to 14˝ (35.5 cm) and insert it through these two holes right across the trebuchet. This is the axle (fulcrum) for the swing arm. 
These vertical supports are not strong enough to sustain repeated use of the trebuchet because there is significant centrifugal force applied in a front-to-back direction. We brace against this force by adding four support pieces that are at an angle to the uprights. Measure and cut four of your 1 × 2s to 30˝ (76 cm) then cut an angle on the ends of each. All four pieces are identical and each piece has a 30-degree angle cut on one end and a 60-degree angle cut on the other end. Screw these to the uprights.
