## Introduction

Everyone knows what a catapult is. It throws stones and flaming projectiles at castles. It is famous – and rightfully so. But for some reason the trebuchet, which is a different type of siege engine, is not so famous. Yet, it is much more powerful than a catapult. It can launch heavier projectiles longer distances and is much easier to build! Rather than using complicated twisted ropes, a trebuchet uses the power of gravity to launch its projectile. In this tutorial you will learn how to build one that is 3 ft (91 cm) tall and capable of launching projectiles at some pretty amazing distances. 

This build is well within reach of a person who has minimal DIY skills. Can you use a drill and a hammer? Then in about six hours you will be launching tennis balls at your neighbour’s house. But don’t do that! Your neighbour might also read this tutorial and build one for themselves. Then you will have a right proper medieval warfare campaign right in your own back yard...

A trebuchet works the same way as a see-saw. If you sit down very quickly on one end of a see-saw, the other end pops up equally quickly. And the heavier the weight, the faster the pop-up. If you shift the fulcrum closer to where you push, the other end will travel even faster. A trebuchet capitalises on this. It uses the principle of a fulcrum and the power of gravity to launch projectiles rapidly into the air.
